        <p>In sooth, we could just keep consuming other people's media and art for the rest of our lives. But why? I thought it would be just neat to do something like what the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Inklings">Inklings</a> did. That is: meet together and read each other our writing. J. R. R. Tolkien persisted in writing The Lord of the Rings in part because of C. S. Lewis' constant encouragement. It is likely that we would not have that masterpiece of story without Lewis. And Lewis would never have come to Christ without Tolkien. Though not a member of the Inklings, G. K. Chesterton, too, provides us with an exemplary model of Christian creativity and artistic output. So if you ever find yourself in your life creating something, I would love to hear about it. I would love to see the Lord's artistic Spirit express himself through you! However, as the pubs are closed, we, the interested parties, we will have to "link" up on the internet instead. I thought maybe once a month or so we could share what we've been working on, whether it be writing or drawing or songwriting or philosophizing or philology-ing or translating or what have you. </p>
        <p>This is the home of the Collected Papers. Herein the reader will find a healthy variety of new art, though we must acknowledge our great indebtedness to those who have gone before. I hope you find yourself just as inspired as we have been!</p>
